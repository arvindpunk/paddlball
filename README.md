# paddlball.cpp

This was a game I built as a school project when I was 17. It has a LOT of flaws and decisions that, looking back at, feels weird. Please remember, the 17 year old me was new to programming and with limited internet access, all of what I learned about graphics was from the Borland TurboC++ in-built help menu (which were really good offline docs).

This was part of the curriculum, I would've chosen a different compiler but had to adhere to school curriculum. (I did try asking if I can use other compilers/libraries).

This implementation outlines some clever optimization techniques to overcome the lack of a 'game engine'. The initial code was undocumented, I took the painstaking task of reading my old code and adding somewhat sensible comments and renaming some variables (younger me thought `i`, `flag`, and `flag1` were good variable names).
